# Code-Quiz
Uses HTML, CSS and JS to create a code quiz
Get questions to display one after another 
Set a timer that subtracts and adds as questions are answered correctly or incorrectly 

Run application in browser, no extensions are needed 

Select Answers in the radio buttons, and manually log score to be added to the leaderboard

The selecting and deslecting answers functions stumped me and I got assistance from a friend in the industry

Javascript needs further debugging to append each of the questions after the start button is clicked
